# Game-Board-with-Trow-Dice-and-PathFinder

This was a challenge to create a board game table with 2 types of rolling dice and a pathfinder system with some obstacles.

The game is Player VS IA 
The player is the green character, and IA is the red character

At the start, the players will be spawned randomly (in the bottom left of the tilemap)

When it's the player's turn, the player can choose if use a normal dice or a special dice
Normal dices go 1-6 and the player can use them with no limit
The Special dices go 5-10 and the player can only use it once every 3 turns.
After the player chooses what dice roll, the player character will move to the destination (the blue tile) by the same numbers of tiles of the rolling dice result.

IA will do automatically everything
A little UI interface helps the user to understand the turn logic and dices results

The goal of this challenge is just to reach the blue tile before the IA 

The time for this challenge was 24h
